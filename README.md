# ITAPI3 - Managed .NET Library for TAPI 3.0 Development

forked from https://itapi3.codeplex.com/

Version 1.0.0.3

Project Description
This C++/CLI library is for applications that want to access TAPI 3.x functions. The existing .NET RCW cannot be used with TAPI 3.0 due to some issues in the TAPI 3.0 COM library.

This wrapper works around those issues and provides a proper wrapped implementation.

If you are interested in using TAPI 2.0, then check out atapi.codeplex.com instead.
